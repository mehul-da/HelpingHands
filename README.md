# HackTX2019
This is a mobile application created in Java using Android Studio in the 24-hour hackathon HackTX. The app, named "Helping Hand",
is supposed to be a means of communication between people in Houston during a crisis (such as the recent Hurricane Harvey flooding) to
donate food, clothing, and other items to people in need of such items (those who have just lost their homes etc).
